The Admin Console requires an S3-compatible object store to store application bundles. By default, the installer will provision Minio (for `kots install` commands) or Rook (for `kurl.sh` installations). During this process, private access keys and secrets are created and added to the Admin Console API. The local object store (minio or rook) is not exposed externally, but access to it is proxied through the Admin Console API.

When deploying the Admin Console to a cloud provider that has native S3-compatible object store services (AWS, GCP and Azure), it can be preferrable to use the native object. There are no application differences, but it may be desirable to offload the management of the object store the the cloud provider.

To enable this.
