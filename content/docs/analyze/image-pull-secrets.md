title: Image Pull Secrets
description: Analyzing the image pull secrets that are available in the cluster
---

The `imagePullSecret` analyzer checks that a secret exists with credentials to pull images from a registry.
It does not verify that the credentials in the secret are valid.

The `imagePullSecret` analyzer uses data from the [clusterResources collector](https://troubleshoot.sh/collect/cluster-resources).
The `clusterResources` collector is automatically added and will always be present.

## Parameters

**registryName**: (Required) The name of the registry to check

```yaml
