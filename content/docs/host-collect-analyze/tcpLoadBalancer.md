description: Collect and analyze information about the ability to connect to the specified TCP load balancer address.

## TCP Load Balancer Collector

To collect information about the ability to connect to the specified TCP load balancer address, you can use the `tcpLoadBalancer` collector. This collector listens on a host port on `0.0.0.0` and then attempts to connect through a TCP load balancer. A successful connection requires sending and receiving a random token through the load balancer to the test server.

### Parameters

In addition to the [shared collector properties](/collect/collectors/#shared-properties), the `tcpLoadBalancer` collector accepts the following parameters:

#### `port` (Required)
The port number to use.

#### `address` (Required)
The address to check the connection to.

#### `timeout` (Optional)
Specifies the total timeout.

### Example Collector Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: loadbalancer
spec:
  hostCollectors:
    - tcpLoadBalancer:
        collectorName: kubernetes-api-lb
        port: 6443
        address: 10.128.0.29:6443
        timeout: 10s
```

### Included Resources

The results of the `tcpLoadBalancer` collector are stored in the `host-collectors/tcpLoadBalancer` directory of the support bundle.

#### `[collector-name].json`

If the `collectorName` field is unset, it will be named `tcpLoadBalancer.json`.

Example of the resulting file:

```
address-in-use
```

## TCP Load Balancer Analyzer

The `tcpLoadBalancer` analyzer supports multiple outcomes:

- `invalid-address`: The load balancer address is not valid.
- `connection-refused`: Connection to the load balancer address was refused.
- `connection-timeout`: Timed out connecting to the load balancer address.
- `address-in-use`: Specified port is unavailable.
- `connected`: Successfully connected to the load balancer address.
- `bind-permission-denied`: Failed to bind to the address:port.
- `error`: Unexpected error connecting to the load balancer address.
