title: Executing Commands
description: Using the exec collector to execute commands in pods
---

The `exec` collector can be used to run a command in an existing pod and include the output in the collected data.
The pod to execute the command is specified as a selector in the collector definition.
When the selector refers to more than one replica of a pod, the exec collector will execute in only one of the pods.
This spec can be included multiple times, each defining different commands and/or label selectors to use.

## Parameters

In addition to the [shared collector properties](/collect/collectors/#shared-properties), the `exec` collector accepts the following parameters:

##### `name` (Optional)
The name of the collector.
This will be the path prefix that the output is written to in the support bundle.

##### `selector` (Required)
The selector to use when locating the pod.
The exec command will execute in the first pod that is returned from the Kubernetes API when queried for this label selector.

##### `namespace` (Optional)
The namespace to look for the pod selector in.
If not specified, it will assume the "current" namespace that the kubectl context is set to.

##### `containerName` (Optional)
The name of the container in which to execute the command. if not specified, the first container in the pod will be used.

##### `command` (Required)
An array of strings containing the command to execute in the pod.

##### `args` (Optional)
An array of strings containing the arguments to pass to the command when executing.

##### `timeout` (Optional)
A [duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration) that will be honored when executing the command.
This cannot be greater than 20 seconds (20s) and if not specified, the default is 20s.

## Example Collector Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  collectors:
    - exec:
        name: mysql-version
        selector:
          - app=mysql
        namespace: default
        command: ["mysql"]
        args: ["-V"]
        timeout: 5s
```


## Included Resources

When this collector is executed, it will include the following file in a support bundle:

### `/[name]/[namespace]/[pod-name]/[collector-name]-stdout.txt`

```
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.44, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
```

The result of running a command in a container may produce the following files if there was an error:

### `/[name]/[namespace]/[pod-name]/[collector-name]-stderr.txt`

```
Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.\nERROR 1064 (42000) at line 1: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'process list' at line 1
```

### `/[name]/[namespace]/[pod-name]/[collector-name]-errors.json`

```json
[
  "command terminated with exit code 1"
]
```
