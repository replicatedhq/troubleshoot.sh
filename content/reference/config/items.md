The admin console settings screen configuration is specified as an array configuration
groups and items.

## Groups

Groups map to links within the left sidebar navigation. Groups are comprised of a `name`,
`title`, `description` and an array of items.

```yaml
config:
- name: authentication
  title: Authentication
  description: Configure application authentication below.
```

## Items

Items map to input fields and belong to a single group. All items should have `name`, `title`
and `type` properties. Specific item types can including new types.

### Available Item Types
> `bool`
> `file`
> `heading`
> `label`
> `password`
> `text`
> `textarea`
> `select`
> `select_many`
> `select_one`

## Examples

### `bool`
The `bool` input type should use a "0" or "1" to set the value
```yaml
- name: toggles
  items:
  - name: http_enabled
    title: HTTP Enabled
    help_text: When enabled we will listen to http
    type: bool
    default: "0"
```

### `label`
The `label` type allows you to display an input label.
```yaml
- name: Email
  items:
  - name: email-address
    title: Email Address
    type: text
  - name: description
    type: label
    title: "Note: The system will send you an email every hour."
```

### `heading`
The `heading` type allows you to display a group heading as a subelement within a group. This is useful when you would like to group items all in one config group but would like to separate the items visually, for instance when using a config group test proc.
```yaml
- name: ldap_settings
  title: LDAP Server Settings
  test_proc:
    display_name: Test Credentials
    command: ldap_auth
    arg_fields:
    - ...
  items:
  ...
  - name: ldap_schema
    type: heading
    title: LDAP schema
  ...
```

### `select`
Types `select_one` and `select_many` are special cases. These types must have nested items
that act as options. These types will be displayed as radio buttons (`select_one`) or
checkboxes (`select_many`) in the admin console.

At this time these two control types do not support the `title` field.

```yaml
- name: inputs
  title: Inputs
  description: ""
  items:
  - name: logstash_input_enabled
    default: ""
    type: select_many
    items:
    - name: logstash_input_file_enabled
      title: File
      default: "0"
    - name: logstash_input_lumberjack_enabled
      title: Lumberjack
      default: "0"
- name: authentication
  title: Authentication
  description: ""
  items:
  - name: authentication_type
    default: authentication_type_anonymous
    type: select_one
    items:
    - name: authentication_type_anonymous
      title: Anonymous
    - name: authentication_type_password
      title: Password
```

### `textarea`
A `textarea` can specify a `props` that will map into the HTML element directly. Examples of available properties are `rows`, `cols` and `wrap`. See https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp for reference.

```yaml
- name: custom_key
  title: Set your secret key for your app
  description: Paste in your Custom Key
  items:
  - name: key
    title: Key
    type: textarea
    props:
      rows: 8
  - name: hostname
    title: Hostname
    type: text
```

### `file`
A `file` is a special type of form field that renders an [`<input type="file" />`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp) HTML element. It has both a value, which holds the file name, and data, the contents of the file. See the [`ConfigOptionData`](https://help.replicated.com/docs/native/packaging-an-application/template-functions/#configoptiondata) template function for examples on how to use the file contents in your application.

```yaml
- name: certs
  title: TLS Configuration
  items:
  - name: tls_private_key_file
    title: Private Key
    when: use_tls=tls_custom
    value: Use self-signed certificate
    data_cmd:
      name: ssl_cert
      value_at: 0
    type: file
    affix: left
  - name: tls_certificate_file
    title: Certificate
    when: use_tls=tls_custom
    value: Use self-signed certificate
    data_cmd:
      name: ssl_cert
      value_at: 1
    type: file
    affix: right
```

## Properties

### `default` and `value`
A default value will be applied to the ConfigOption template function when no value is
specified. A default value provided via a command (default_cmd) is treated as ephemeral
data that will get overwritten each time commands are executed. It will appear as
placeholder text in the settings section of the On-Prem Console.

A value is data that will be overwritten by user input on non-readonly fields. A value
provided as the result of a command (value_cmd or data_cmd) will persist and will never
change after the first execution of the command. It will appear as the HTML input value
in the settings section of the On-Prem Console.

*Please note that setting ```readonly:true``` will render a value generated by a command to be ephemeral.  This feature has since been deprecated and may change in the future.*

```yaml
- name: custom_key
  title: Set your secret key for your app
  description: Paste in your Custom Key
  items:
  - name: key
    title: Key
    type: text
    value: ""
    default: change me
```

### `required`
A required field will prevent the application from starting until it has a value.
```yaml
    required: true
```

### `when`
The when value is used to denote conditional inputs that will only be visible (or required) when the condition evaluates to true. The `when` item can be used on groups, items and select_one or select_many options.

The settings UI will update right away when a field used in a when clause is updated (no need to save) and can be used to used to show optional config sections. The equality check should match exactly without quotes.

```yaml
- name: database_settings_group
  items:
  - name: db_type
    type: select_one
    default: embedded
    items:
    - name: external
      title: External
    - name: embedded
      title: Embedded DB
  - name: database_host
    title: Database Hostname
    type: text
    when: db_type=external
  - name: database_password
    title: Database Password
    type: password
    when: '{{repl or (ConfigOptionEquals "db_type" "external") (ConfigOptionEquals "db_type" "embedded")}}'
```

### `recommended`
An item can be recommended. This item will bear the tag "recommended" in the admin console.
```yaml
    recommended: true
```

### `hidden`
Items can be hidden. They will not be visible if hidden.
```yaml
    hidden: true
```

### `readonly`
Items can be readonly.
```yaml
    readonly: true
```

### `write_once`
Items with the write_once property set to true will be locked the first time they are set.
Locked items will appear readonly in the UI and will be ignored if set with `replicatedctl` or imported from a file.

Any operation that sets an item is considered a write and will cause the item to be locked. This includes setting the item value in the UI, importing the value from a file specified in `/etc/replicated.conf` with the `ImportSettingsFrom` key, setting the value with `replicatedctl`, or setting the value with `value_cmd`.

If the item has a `default` it will be locked the first time the user saves settings in the admin console.
It is recommended to avoid using `default` with `write_once` items.

```yaml
    write_once: true
```

### `affix`
Items can be affixed left or right. These items will appear in the admin console on the same line.
```yaml
    affix: left
```

## Using CMD (commands) as input to options

Commands can be used as defaults, values, or data with `default_cmd`, `value_cmd` and
`data_cmd` respectively. Data is a special property of the file type. The value corresponds
to the file name while the data corresponds to its contents.

```yaml
    value_cmd:
      name: hash_key
      value_at: 0
```
