Welcome.
The easiest way to get started with the Troubleshoot project is to go through a few short tutorials.
Once you've completed these tutorials, you'll be set to add custom Preflight Checks to your application and build your own Support Bundle for disconnected troubleshooting.

<div class="side-by-side">
  <div class="flex1">

    <p>Start here to learn how to add custom preflight checks to your application.</p>
    <Link to="/preflight/introduction" class="custom-button primary">
      Start the tutorial!
    </Link>
  </div>

  <div class="flex1">
    <h4>Support Bundle</h4>
    <p>
    When you have an application to support, start here to learn how to define a custom support bundle.
    We'll walk through collecting data from the application and analyzing it for known errors and problems.
