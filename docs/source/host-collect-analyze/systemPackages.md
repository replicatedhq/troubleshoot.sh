### Example Collector Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: systemPackages
spec:
  hostCollectors:
    - systemPackages:
        collectorName: system-packages
        ubuntu:
          - open-iscsi
        ubuntu20:
          - nmap
          - nfs-common
        centos:
          - iscsi-initiator-utils
        centos7:
          - libzstd
        centos8:
          - nfs-utils
          - openssl
```

### Included Resources

The results of the `systemPackages` collector are stored in the `host-collectors/system` directory of the support bundle.

#### `[collector-name].json`

If the `collectorName` field is unset, it will be named `packages.json`.

Example of the resulting JSON file:

```json

        "name": "nmap"
      }
    ]
}
```

## System Packages Analyzer

The `systemPackages` analyzer is used to analyze information about the collected packages. For example, the analyzer can check whether a certain package is installed, if the version of a package is greater than or equal to a certain version, and more. The analyzer also supports template functions to help customize the outcomes as desired.

Some of the fields that are accessible using template functions are detailed in the following JSON object:

```json
{
  "OS": "ubuntu",
  "OSVersion": "18.04",
  "OSVersionMajor": "18",
  "OSVersionMinor": "4",
  "Name": "openssl",
  "Error": "",
  "ExitCode": "0",
  "IsInstalled": true,
}
```

The analyzer also has access to the fields in the details field for a package from the collector. For example, in the details field in the collector output above, you can reference the Version field with {{ .Version }}.
