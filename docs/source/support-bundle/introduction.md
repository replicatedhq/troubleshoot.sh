This tutorial will walk you through defining a Support Bundle that your customer can execute when something isn't working quite right.
A support bundle will collect data from the cluster, redact sensitive fields, and then perform analysis on the data to provide remediation steps.

## Goals

By completing this tutorial, you will know how to write a Support Bundle, including:

1. How to collect data
2. How to analyze collected data
3. How to generate a support bundle from a cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have the following:

1. The Troubleshoot plugins [installed](/#installation).
1. A Kubernetes cluster and local kubectl access to the cluster. If you don't have one for testing, consider [kURL](https://kurl.sh), [KiND](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind), or [K3S](https://k3s.io).
