title: Cluster Info
description: Including details about the Kubernetes cluster
---

The `clusterInfo` collector will add common information about a Kubernetes cluster.

This collector is a default collector and it will be automatically included in your collector spec if you don't include it.
This collector cannot be removed.

## Parameters

The `clusterInfo` collector supports the [shared collector properties](https://troubleshoot.io) and no additional parameters.

## Example Collector Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Collector
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  collectors:
    - clusterInfo: {}
```

## Included resources

When the `clusterInfo` collector is executed it will include the following file(s):

### `/cluster-info/cluster-version.json`

This file contains information describing the Kubernetes cluster version.

```json
{
  "info": {
    "major": "1",
    "minor": "13",
    "gitVersion": "v1.13.6",
