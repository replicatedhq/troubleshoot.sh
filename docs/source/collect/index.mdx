title: Collecting Data
description: Introduction to the collect phase
introHeader: collect
---

Every support bundle or preflight check starts with a collect phase.
During this time, information is collected from the cluster, the environment, the application and other sources to be used later in the analysis or preflight results.

When designing a support bundle or preflight check, be sure to add all necessary data to the collectors.
The [analyze phase](/analyze/) can only use the output of the collect phase to perform analysis and provide results, however a large set of collectors are included automatically.

## Including Collectors

To specify the data to include for later phases, the collect phase accepts a Kubernetes custom resource as defined here.
A [full reference of the collectors](/collect/collectors/) is also available.

Collectors are specified inside either a Preflight or a SupportBundle YAML file. To build a set of collectors, start with a Kubernetes YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Preflight
metadata:
  name: my-application-name
spec:
  collectors: []
```

or

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: my-application-name
spec:
  collectors: []
```

> Note: `troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2` was introduced in preflight and support-bundle krew plugin version 0.9.39 and Kots version 1.19.0. Kots vendors should [read the guide to maintain backwards compatibility](/v1beta2/). Also note: Previously, Collectors could be specified in a standalone file, with `Kind: Collector`, however this syntax is deprecated in Kots 1.19.0 and not supported at all in the krew plugins.

The above file is a simple, but valid set of collectors.
It will collect only the default data.

To add additional collectors, specify each one in the `collectors` array.
Each collector can be included multiple times, if there are different sets of options to use.

For example, a complete spec might be:

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: my-application-name
spec:
  collectors:
    - clusterInfo: {}
    - clusterResources: {}
    - logs:
        selector:
          - app=api
        namespace: default
        limits:
          maxAge: 720h
          maxLines: 1000
    - http:
        name: healthz
        get:
          url: http://api:3000/healthz
    - exec:
        name: mysql-version
        selector:
          - app=mysql
        namespace: default
        command: ["mysql"]
        args: ["-V"]
        timeout: 5s
```
