Welcome.
The easiest way to get started with the Troubleshoot project is to see it in action through a couple examples. 

## Installation

Do one of the following to install:

- Download and uncompress the latest release binary

  To install the latest release, download and uncompress the latest release asset for the target platform from the [release page](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/releases):
  ```
  curl -L https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/releases/latest/download/support-bundle_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xzvf -
  curl -L https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/releases/latest/download/preflight_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xzvf -
  sudo ./support-bundle version
  sudo ./preflight version
  ```

- Install with krew

  You can execute Preflight Checks and Support Bundles using a client-side utility, packaged as a `kubectl` plugin that is distributed through the [krew](https://krew.dev/) package manager.
  If you don't already have krew installed, head over to the [krew installation guide](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/), follow the steps there and then come back here.
  
  Install the Preflight and Support Bundle plugin using:
  
  ```shell
  kubectl krew install preflight
  kubectl krew install support-bundle
  ```

  **Note:** This will not install anything to your cluster, it only places a single binary per plugin in your path.

## Examples

Now that you have the plugins installed lets look at a simple example of a Preflight Check and a Support Bundle to get a sense for how they are structured and how to run them.

### Example Preflight check

Preflight Checks can be executed before installing an application into a Kubernetes cluster. The checks are defined in a YAML file. Run the following command on your cluster to see an example Preflight Check.

```shell
# using krew
kubectl preflight https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/main/examples/preflight/sample-preflight.yaml
# using installation
sudo ./preflight https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/main/examples/preflight/sample-preflight.yaml
```

### Example Support Bundle

A Support Bundle needs to know what to collect and optionally, what to analyze. This is defined in a YAML file. There's a lot already included in the default collectors. Run the following command on your cluster to see an example Support Bundle.

```shell
# using krew
kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
# using installation
sudo ./support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
```
