Welcome.
The easiest way to get started with the Troubleshoot project is to see it in action through a couple examples. 

## Installation
Executing Preflight Checks and Support Bundles relies on a client-side utility, packages as a `kubectl` plugin and distributed through the [krew](https://krew.dev/) pacakge manager.
If you don't already have krew installed, head over to the [krew installation guide](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/), follow the steps there and then come back here.

Install the Preflight and Support Bundle plugin using:

```shell
kubectl krew install preflight
kubectl krew install support-bundle
```

Note: This will not install anything to your cluster, it only places a single binary per plugin in your path.

## Examples

Now that you have the plugins installed lets look at a simple example of a Preflight Check and a Support Bundle to get a sense for how they are structured and how to run them.

### Example Preflight check

Preflight Checks can be executed by your customer before installing your application into their Kubernetes cluster. The checks are defined in a YAML file. Here is an example of a simle Preflight Check that could be used to enforce a minimum Kubernetes version on your cluster.

```
apiVersion: troubleshoot.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Preflight
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-version
  annotations: 
    title: "Check the version of Kubernetes"
    description: "Require a minimum of Kubernetes 1.16.0"
    category: "cluster_info"
    iconUri: "/category-icons/kubernetes.svg"
    tags: '["kubernetes"]'
    contributors: '[{"name": "Marc Campbell", "avatarUri": "https://avatars3.githubu
spec:
  collectors: []
  analyzers:
    - clusterVersion:
        outcomes:
          - fail:
              when: "< 1.16.0"
              message: The application requires at Kubernetes 1.16.0 or later, and
              uri: https://kubernetes.io
          - warn:
              when: "< 1.18.0"
              message: Your cluster meets the minimum version of Kubernetes, but we
              uri: https://kubernetes.io
          - pass:
              message: Your cluster meets the recommended and required versions of K
```

Ready to try it out? Execute the following command to see the results of this Kubernetes version check Preflight Check.

```
kubectl preflight https://troubleshoot.run/nCA5lOsuA
```

Now lets use the same YAML to define a Support Bundle

### Example Support Bundle

A Support Bundle needs to know what to collect and optionally, what to analyze. This is defined in a YAML file. Here is an example of a Support Bundle that collects the version of Kubernetes using the same YAML we wrote for the Preflight Check

```
apiVersion: troubleshoot.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-version
  annotations: 
    title: "Check the version of Kubernetes"
    description: "Require a minimum of Kubernetes 1.16.0"
    category: "cluster_info"
    iconUri: "/category-icons/kubernetes.svg"
    tags: '["kubernetes"]'
    contributors: '[{"name": "Marc Campbell", "avatarUri": "https://avatars3.githubu
spec:
  collectors: []
  analyzers:
    - clusterVersion:
        outcomes:
          - fail:
              when: "< 1.16.0"
              message: The application requires at Kubernetes 1.16.0 or later, and 
              uri: https://kubernetes.io
          - warn:
              when: "< 1.18.0"
              message: Your cluster meets the minimum version of Kubernetes, but we
              uri: https://kubernetes.io
          - pass:
              message: Your cluster meets the recommended and required versions of K
```

Lets try it out and see what is collected by our Support Bundle. Execute the following command.

```
kubectl support-bundle https://troubleshoot.run/nRzwLhV0z
```

### Using local files

If you have an analyzer or support bundle definition as a file, you can run it with:

```
kubectl preflight <filename>
```
