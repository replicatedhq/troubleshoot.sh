Welcome.
The easiest way to get started with the Troubleshoot project is to see it in action through a couple examples. 

## Installation
Executing Preflight Checks and Support Bundles relies on a client-side utility, packages as a `kubectl` plugin and distributed through the [krew](https://krew.dev/) package manager.
If you don't already have krew installed, head over to the [krew installation guide](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/), follow the steps there and then come back here.

Install the Preflight and Support Bundle plugin using:

```shell
kubectl krew install preflight
kubectl krew install support-bundle
```

Note: This will not install anything to your cluster, it only places a single binary per plugin in your path.

## Examples

Now that you have the plugins installed lets look at a simple example of a Preflight Check and a Support Bundle to get a sense for how they are structured and how to run them.

### Example Preflight check

Preflight Checks can be executed by your customer before installing your application into their Kubernetes cluster. The checks are defined in a YAML file. Here is an example of a simple Preflight Check that could be used to enforce a minimum Kubernetes version on your cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Preflight
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-version
spec:
  collectors: []
  analyzers:
    - clusterVersion:
        outcomes:
          - fail:
              when: < 1.16.0
              message: >-
                The application requires at Kubernetes 1.16.0 or later, and
                recommends 1.18.0.
              uri: 'https://kubernetes.io'
          - warn:
              when: < 1.18.0
              message: >-
                Your cluster meets the minimum version of Kubernetes, but we
                recommend you update to 1.18.0 or later.
              uri: 'https://kubernetes.io'
          - pass:
              message: >-
                Your cluster meets the recommended and required versions of
                Kubernetes.
```

Ready to try it out? Copy that YAML into a local file named `check.yaml` and run the following command to see the results of this Kubernetes version check Preflight Check.

```shell
kubectl preflight check.yaml
```

### Example Support Bundle

Now lets use similar YAML to define a Support Bundle.

A Support Bundle needs to know what to collect and optionally, what to analyze. This is defined in a YAML file. There's a lot already included in the default collectors. Here is an example of a Support Bundle that collects the version of Kubernetes using similar YAML we wrote for the Preflight Check.

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-version
spec:
  collectors: []
  analyzers:
    - clusterVersion:
        outcomes:
          - fail:
              when: < 1.16.0
              message: >-
                The application requires at Kubernetes 1.16.0 or later, and
                recommends 1.18.0.
              uri: 'https://kubernetes.io'
          - warn:
              when: < 1.18.0
              message: >-
                Your cluster meets the minimum version of Kubernetes, but we
                recommend you update to 1.18.0 or later.
              uri: 'https://kubernetes.io'
          - pass:
              message: >-
                Your cluster meets the recommended and required versions of
                Kubernetes.
```

Lets try it out and see what is collected by our Support Bundle. Save the YAML into a local file named `bundle.yaml` and execute the following command.

```shell
kubectl support-bundle bundle.yaml
```
