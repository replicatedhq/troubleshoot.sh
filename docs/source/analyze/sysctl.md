title: Sysctl
description: Analyze sysctl parameter values
---

The `sysctl` analyzer checks the output of the [Sysctl](/collect/sysctl/) collector.

## Paramaters

*There are no parameters available for this analyzer.*

## Outcomes

The conditional in the `when` tests whether a `sysctl` parameter is equal to a value for at least one node.
For example, the conditional `when: net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0` evaluates to `true` if at least one node is found to have IP forwarding disabled.

All nodes for which the condition is `true` are prefixed to the message in the outcome.
For example, if the outcome message is `IP forwarding not enabled`, and the nodes `a.example.com` and `c.example.com` were matching the condition, the result message would be `Nodes a.example.com, b.example.com: IP forwarding not enabled`.
