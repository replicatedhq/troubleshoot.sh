title: Deployment Status
description: Analyzing the current status of a Kubernetes Deployment
---

The `deploymentStatus` analyzer is used to report on the number of replicas that are "Ready" in a deployment.
The `when` attribute supports standard comparators to compare the number of ready replicas.

The `deploymentStatus` analyzer requires that the [clusterResources](https://troubleshoot.sh/collect/cluster-resources) is included in the support bundle.
The `clusterResources` collectors is automatically added and will always be present.

The target deployment can be identified by name. T
he outcomes on this analyzer will be processed in order, and execution will stop after the first outcome that is truthy.

## Parameters

**name**: (Required) The name of the deployment to check

**namespace**: (Required) The namespace to look for the deployment in.
