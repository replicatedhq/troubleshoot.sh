title: Kubernetes Distribution
description: Analyzing the Kubernetes distribution that's running
---

The `distribution` analyzer is used to check for known managed (hosted) and self-hosted versions of Kubernetes.
The `when` attribute supports standard comparators to compare the result to.

The `distribution` analyzer uses data from the [clusterResources collector](https://troubleshoot.sh/collect/cluster-resources).
The `clusterResources` collector is automatically added and will always be present.

## Parameters

*There are no parameters available for this analyzer.*
