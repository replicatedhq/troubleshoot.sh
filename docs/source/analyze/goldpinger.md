description: Analyze goldpinger results
---

The goldpinger analyzer is used to analyze results collected by the [goldpinger collector](/collect/goldpinger/). The goldpinger analyzer reports the following:
- Failed outcome for each pod to pod ping that was not successful.
- Warning outcome if any pod ping result is missing
- Success for each pod that successfully pinged all other pods in a cluster

*NOTE: A ping in goldpinger terminology involves making a http request as opposed to making an ICMP ping request*

## Parameters

- ##### `filePath` (Optional)
  Optional parameter pointing to where goldpinger results are collected. By default, this is `goldpinger/check_all.json`
