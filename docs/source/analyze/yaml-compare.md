title: YAML Compare
description: Compare YAML snippets
---

The YAML compare analyzer is used to compare a YAML snippet with part or all of a collected YAML file.

## Parameters

**fileName**: (Required) Path of the collected file to analyze.

**value**: (Required) YAML value to compare.
If the value matches the collected file, the outcome that has `when` set to `"true"` will be executed.
If a `when` expression is not specified, the `pass` outcome defaults to `"true"`.

**path**: (Optional) Portion of the collected YAML file to compare against.
The default behavior is to compare against the entire collected file.

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Preflight
metadata:
  name: yaml-compare-example
spec:

    - data:
        name: example.yaml
        data: |
          foo: bar
          stuff:
            foo: bar
            bar: foo
          morestuff:
          - foo:

  analyzers:
    - yamlCompare:
        checkName: Compare YAML Example
        fileName: example.yaml
        path: "morestuff.[0].foo"
        value: |
          bar: 123
        outcomes:
          - fail:
              when: "false"
