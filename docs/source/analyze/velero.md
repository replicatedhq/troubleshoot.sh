title: Velero
description: Check backup, restore settings and status.
---

The `Velero` analyzer is available to check statuses of Custom Resources installed by velero, such as: backup storage locations, backup repositories, backups and restores.

## Parameters

**collectorName:** (N/A) Velero currently does not require a special collector as all the Custom Resources are already collected in support bundle by the `Cluster Resources` collector.

## Example Analyzer Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: velero
spec:
  collectors:
    - clusterResources: {} # implicitly added if not defined in a spec
    - logs:
        namespace: velero
        name: velero/logs
  analyzers:
    - velero: {}
```

**Note**

For the logs collector:
- `name` should always be `velero/logs` as it's the default path created in support bundle to be then used by velero analyzer.
- `namespace` could be changed to any other namespace in case velero was installed in a different namespace.
