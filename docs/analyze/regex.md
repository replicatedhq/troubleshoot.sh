The regex analyzer is used to run arbitrary regular expressions against text data collected into a bundle. You can use the regex analyzer with any text data collector, such as the `data`, `runPod`, `runDaemonSet`, `copy`, `logs`, and `exec` collectors.

## Parameters

Either `regex` or `regexGroups` must be set but not both.

This analyzer uses the Go library [`regexp`](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp) from the Go standard library and uses Go's [RE2 regular expression syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)

**regex**: (Optional) A regex pattern to test.
If the pattern matches the file, the outcome that has set `when` to `"true"` will be executed.
If no `when` expression has been specified, the `pass` outcome defaults to `"true"`.

**regexGroups**: (Optional)  A regex pattern to match.
Matches from named capturing groups are available to `when` expressions in outcomes. The captured group names can be used as template variables in the `when` outcome message. These template variables will be replaced by the strings extracted through regular expression matching.

**fileName** (Required) Path to the file in support bundle to analyze.
This can be an exact name, a prefix, or a file path pattern as defined by Go's [`filepath.Match`](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) function.

**ignoreIfNoFiles** (Optional)  If no file matches, this analyzer will produce a warn outcome by default. This flag can be set to `true` in order to suppress the warning.

## Example Analyzer Definition for regex

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  collectors:
    - logs:
        selector:
          - app=my-app
        name: my-app
  analyzers:
    - textAnalyze:
        checkName: Database Authentication
        fileName: my-app/my-app-0/my-app.log
        regex: 'FATAL: password authentication failed for user'
        outcomes:
          - pass:
              when: "false"
              message: "Database credentials okay"
          - fail:
              when: "true"
              message: "Problem with database credentials"
```

## Example Analyzer Definition for regexGroups

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: SupportBundle
metadata:
  name: ping
spec:
  collectors:
    - run:
        collectorName: "run-ping"
        image: busybox:1
        name: ping.txt
        namespace: default
        command: ["ping"]
        args: ["-w", "10", "-c", "10", "-i", "0.3", "www.google.com"]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  analyzers:
    - textAnalyze:
        checkName: "run-ping"
        fileName: ping.txt/run-ping.log
        regexGroups: '(?P<Transmitted>\d+) packets? transmitted, (?P<Received>\d+) packets? received, (?P<Loss>\d+)(\.\d+)?% packet loss'
        outcomes:
          - pass:
              when: "Loss < 5"
              message: "{{ .Transmitted }} packets transmitted and {{ .Received }} packets received with {{ .Loss }}% packet loss"
          - fail:
              message: "High packet loss of {{ .Loss }}%"
```
